abstract = "We derive a fractional Fokker-Planck equation for subdiffusion in a general space- and time-dependent force field from power law waiting time continuous time random walks biased by Boltzmann weights. The governing equation is derived from a generalized master equation and is shown to be equivalent to a subordinated stochastic Langevin equation."
