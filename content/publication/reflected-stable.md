# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper explicitly computes the transition densities of a spectrally negative stable process with index greater than one, reflected at its infimum. First we derive the forward equation using the theory of sun-dual semigroups. The resulting forward equation is a boundary value problem on the positive half-line that involves a negative Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative in space, and a fractional reflecting boundary condition at the origin. Then we apply numerical methods to explicitly compute the transition density of this space-inhomogeneous Markov process, for any starting point, to any desired degree of accuracy. Finally, we discuss an application to fractional Cauchy problems, which involve a positive Caputo fractional derivative in time."
