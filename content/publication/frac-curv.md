abstract = "Most of the known methods for estimating the fractal dimension of fractal sets are based on the evaluation of a single geometric characteristic, e.g. the volume of its parallel sets. We propose a method involving the evaluation of several geometric characteristics, namely all the intrinsic volumes (i.e. volume, surface area, Euler characteristic, etc.) of the parallel sets of a fractal. Motivated by recent results on their limiting behavior, we use these functionals to estimate the fractal dimension of sets from digital images. Simultaneously, we also obtain estimates of the fractal curvatures of these sets, some fractal counterpart of intrinsic volumes, allowing a finer classification of fractal sets than by means of fractal dimension only. We show the consistency of our estimators and test them on some digital images of self-similar sets."
