<p>The new <a href="https://strakaps.github.io/CTRE/">R package <code>CTRE</code></a> is now
available on CRAN. “CTRE” stands for “Continuous Time Random Exceedances”,
which is a model for extreme values of bursty time series.
The theory is desribed in another paper
(<a href="https://strakaps.github.io/bursty-POT/">html</a>|<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05218.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>

<p>The above time series are measurements of solar flare magnitudes by NASA<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Which observations are considered extreme is defined by a variable threshold <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>
(dashed line, <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 5\%\)</span> of observations).
The exceedances of this threshold (red) follow (asymptotically for high <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>)
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Pareto_distribution">Generalized Pareto distribution</a>.
This type of modelling of extremes is standard in Extreme Value Theory,
and known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory#Data_analysis">Peaks Over Threshold</a>
(POT) method.
To date,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExtremeValue.html"><em>18 R packages</em></a>
have been developed for POT!</p>

<h2>What’s new about <code>CTRE</code>?</h2>
<p><code>CTRE</code> provides a new way to model the <strong>bursty timing</strong> of the threshold
crossings. In complex systems, <em>inter-event times</em> are typically
heavy-tailed<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and thus highly heterogeneous
(think income distributions).
The bulk of inter-event times is short, corresponding to Bursts of events.
A few very long inter-event times represent quiet periods.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://strakaps.github.io/MittagLeffleR/">Mittag-Leffler distribution</a>
is universal for times between threshold crossings, see the
<a href="https://strakaps.github.io/bursty-POT/">companion paper</a>.
<code>CTRE</code> fits a Mittag-Leffler distribution to a range of threshold values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>flares_ctre &lt;- thin(flares_ctre, k = 700)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
MLestimates(flares_ctre, tail = 0.9, scale = 3E7)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/ctre-package_files/figure-html/stability-plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Above, the threshold is varied from the 5th to the 700th largest magnitude
(as you move right along the x-axes)
and the parameters estimates are plotted on the y-axis.
For both panels, towards the left (exceedances=5), only few data are available,
and the estimate has a high variance.
Towards the right (exceedances = 700), the threshold is low, and the
Mittag-Leffler fit degrades (high bias).
In between is where we want to read off our (hopefully stable) parameter
estimates. The above plots are hence called “stability plots”.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Important:</dt>
<dd><p>The scale parameter is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(k^{-1/\beta}\)</span>.
The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is hence used to rescale the y-values of the
right-hand plot, in order to make the estimates constant, and needs to
estimated from the left-hand plot first.</p>
</dd>

<div id="ctre-applied-to-data" class="section level2">
<h2><code>CTRE</code> applied to data</h2>
<p>For the solar flare data, we read off
<span class="math display">\[
\beta \approx 0.9, \quad \sigma \approx 3 \times 10^7.
\]</span>
This means that the inter-arrival time <span class="math inline">\(T(k)\)</span> for magnitudes as high as the
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th magnitude is distributed as
<span class="math display">\[
T(k) \sim {\rm ML}\left(0.9, \frac{3 \times 10^7 {\rm sec}}{k^{1/0.9}} \right).
\]</span>
For example, let’s assume the magnitude (peak rate) <span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span>. How many
magnitudes exceed it?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)
(flares_ctre %&gt;% magnitudes() %&gt;% sort(decreasing=TRUE) &gt; 10000) %&gt;% sum()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 24</code></pre>
<p>So substitute <span class="math inline">\(k = 24\)</span>. The model thus predicts inter-arrival times drawn from the
distribution
<span class="math display">\[
{\rm ML}\left(0.9, 8.8\times 10^{5} {\rm sec} \right)
= {\rm ML}\left(0.9, 10 {\rm days} \right).
\]</span></p>
<p>Here’s the plot of this distribution, on a logarithmic scale:</p>
<p><img src="/post/ctre-package_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>Compared to the Exponential distribution, the Mittag-Leffler distribution
puts more probability mass on both tiny values (Bursts) and
values in the tails (quiet periods).</p>

<div id="what-about-clustering-of-extremes" class="section level2">
<h2>What about “clustering of extremes”?</h2>
<p>The main other appraoch in Extreme Value Theory which addresses irregular
(non-Poissonian) threshold crossing times goes under the name
“clustering of extremes”.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It assumes that the underlying
process is stationary, and conflates each excursion of the process
above the threshold as one cluster of events.</p>
<p>CTREs and clustering of extremes both generalize the standard
assumption of independent events, but in
different directions. They are hence complementary, and it needs to be
investigated how they should be compared meaningfully.</p>
