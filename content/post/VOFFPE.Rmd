The new paper
([arxiv.org/abs/1712.06767](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06767))

> *Variable Order Fractional Fokker-Planck
> Equations derived from Continuous Time Random Walks*

is currently under review.

The variable order fractional
Fokker-Planck equation (VOFFPE),
in simple form[^3], is
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} p(x,t) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
\underbrace{D_t^{1-\beta(x)}}_{\text{fractional derivative}}
p(x,t).$$

[^3]: Drift and diffusivity are left out here, but they may be any
(Lipschitz-) continuous functions.

* If you take out the fractional derivative operator, you get the
[**Fokker-Planck equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker%E2%80%93Planck_equation) **(FPE)**.
It describes the spreading of probability via a random walk:

* Adding in the
[fractional derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_calculus)
$$D_t^{1-\beta} p(x,t) = \int_0^t p(x,t-s) \frac{s^{-\beta}}{\Gamma(1-\beta)}\,ds$$
results in the "**fractional FPE**". The fractional derivative
corresponds to longs rests of a walker, and slows down the spreading (making the
dynamics "sub"diffusive).

* Here the order $1-\beta$ of the fractional derivative varies with the
location $x$ of the walker, hence the name VOFFPE
(**variable order fractional FPE**).
In some regions, e.g. where the intracellular matrix of a cell is dense[^4],
the trappingness can be stronger, which is modelled by a smaller $\beta(x)$
in that region.

The paper shows that the equation has a unique solution $p(x,t)$, and that
this solution is the probability distribution of a Continuous Time
Random Walk (CTRW)[^1].
CTRWs are random walks with random waiting times between
jumps:

The fractional derivative in time is tightly linked with
[Mittag-Leffler distributed](/post/mittag-leffler/) waiting times.

[^1]: Strictly speaking, a scaling limit of a CTRW.

Of course CTRWs can be simulated, and $p(x,t)$ may be computed via
Monte Carlo simulations (or
"[particle tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-particle_tracking)").
Thus a consequence of
the paper is the mathematical certainty that the variable order FFPE
(VOFFPE) can be solved by simulations.

The variable order FFPE can also be solved directly, via clever numerical
algorithms. The CTRW interpretation of the VOFFPE can be leveraged for
such a clever numerical algorithm, as our friends over in applied maths
have done with their
[Discrete Time Random Walk algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2014.08.003).
This approach has several great benefits[^2], and now we know how to
extend these benefits to the variable order setting (to be continued).

[^2]: E.g. conservation of mass and non-negative solutions.
